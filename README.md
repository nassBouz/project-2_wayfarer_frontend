# Wayfarer Front End
The front-end section for Wayfarer was created by Paris Taylor, Tiffany Teaze, Nassima Bouziane, and Jonathan Jolivette. Our short time spend on this project taught us how to create a react application with node, mongoose, and mongodb primarily. Our application helps travelers catalogue their favorite travel destinations.

## Our Approach and Process
We believe that every great project begins with good planning from start to finish. So, we tracked our projects development in trello: https://trello.com/b/NHSCMc4E/wayfarer-project-product-mgmt-fantastic-4
We began by wire-framing out our database structure, our component and dom tree, user stories, and sprints for each step of the way. We also began by setting up file structures and platforms so we could all start the project with the same tech. 

<br />
The responses from the backend were more important than our front-end functionality at first, given that our team has pretty good design sense. But we launched into styling the appas soon as we could.

## Challenges and Wins
Some challenges for us were:
* User authentication was a big win and challenge
* Fully functional routes and controllers for each route
* trying to work around materialize
* axios calls for posts. Specifically grabbing by id
* styling in css react

<br />
One of our biggest challenges was authentication. We learned that every route that requires a JWT token needed special attention and detail-oriented focus.

Some of our wins were getting the user signed up and logged in and getting their information to render on their profile. Implementing all of our CRUD methods, and working out the bugs was also a big win. As we worked on these features, sometimes we found unnoticed bugs in previous parts of the code and we had to fix those issues first. 
<br />
Our team worked especially well when it came to pair programing. We found it much less painful to code with someone with a similar work-ethic and passion for good products.
## Unsolved Problems
* Finalizing our axios calls
* Refactoring/Optimization
* Some style elements
